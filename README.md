# AITalentFairEU (AITFE): Smart Selection & Salary Clarity
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

With the introduction of Directive (EU) 2023/970 – “Equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women – Rules on pay transparency” – EU members have obligation to transpose these rules in the national frameworks, the deadline for implementation at a national level is the 6 June 2026. This may become a perfect opportunity to provide a new exciting EU wide AI solution for a job seekers and recruiters alike. 


## Legal Framework Background

The regulation primary focus is on closing unjustified gender pay gap men/women – but as far as I am concerned this in fact is far more reaching than just differences in gender pay tracking and resolution, as in fact the data obtained may reveal much more information beyond the original purpose and if analysed and applied correctly, can and will benefit the entire population of all employees giving a way to revolutionary solutions that can shape futures of millions of people in the EU.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE (EU) 2023/970?
It lays down minimum rules to reinforce:

respect for the principle of equal pay* for equal work or work of equal value between men and women;
the prohibition of any direct or indirect pay discrimination* on grounds of sex;
pay transparency and stronger enforcement of the right to equal pay.
KEY POINTS
The directive applies to:

public and private sector employers;
all workers with an employment contract or employment relationship defined by law, collective agreement and/or practice.
Equal pay for equal work or work of equal value

European Union (EU) Member States ensure that employers have pay structures that exclude any pay discrimination on grounds of sex.
The assessment of comparable work is to be based on criteria including skills, effort, responsibility and working conditions, and other criteria that are relevant to the specific job or position. Criteria must be applied in an objective gender-neutral manner, excluding any direct or indirect discrimination based on sex.
Pay transparency measures stipulate that:

job applicants:
have the right to information from the prospective employer before an interview on the initial pay of the job position or its range and, where relevant, details of the provisions of the collective agreement applied by the employer in relation to the position;
workers:
have the right to request (directly or through their workers’ representatives or national equality body) information on their individual pay level and the average pay levels, broken down by sex, for categories of workers performing the same work as them or work of equal value to theirs,
will not be prevented from disclosing their pay for the purpose of the enforcement of the principle of equal pay;
employers:
may not ask job applicants about their current or previous pay,
ensure that vacancy notices and job titles are gender neutral and recruitment processes are non-discriminatory,
make easily accessible to their workers the criteria that are used to determine workers’ pay, pay levels and pay progression, and those criteria shall be objective and gender neutral,
inform all their employees annually of their right to request and receive in writing information on their individual pay and average pay levels broken down by sex for colleagues doing the same work or work of equal value,
provide information such as the gender pay gap and the proportion of female and male staff receiving complementary or variable components (this requirement will be gradually introduced from 7 June 2027, for employers with more than 100 workers, depending on company size),
cooperate with workers’ representatives to identify, remedy and prevent discriminatory pay differences when their pay reporting reveals a gender pay gap above 5% that cannot be justified by objective, gender-neutral criteria and was not tackled within 6 months.
Member States:

ensure the availability of analytical tools or methodologies to assess and compare the value of different jobs at the employer’s level;
provide technical assistance and training to help employers with fewer than 250 staff comply with the requirements of the directive;
take measures to ensure social partners are actively involved, without prejudice to the autonomy of the social partners and in accordance with national law and practice.

## AI Solution Background

The creative solution can support all employees during and even before the commencement of professional life, by providing reliable and transparent tool for a well informed career planning. This can be achieved by data driven analysis model used to compare existing real live data on salary thresholds versus employees profiles (i.e. skills, education, experience etc.) versus purchasing power parity (PPP) across different geographies of the EU as well as it could extrapolate employment trends based of historic data growth/decline in employment numbers per sector/ business line/ region etc..   

From the HR & recruitment perspectives the solution could eliminate some or common screening errors where the CVs are beings erroneously rejected due to automated screening tools being unable recognise differences in key word paraphrasing, or insufficient HR experience in specialist areas which could lead to unjustified candidates rejection and losing out on best talent sourcing opportunities. Transparency across sectors/ roles/ geographies would also benefit HR departments and Compensation Boards to better align their remuneration processes and avoid potential mismatch between expected and actual salary levels. Another attention point may be associated with the profiles of the candidates, if some employees in country “A” perform a specific job with set of skills, experience, education “abc” but in country “B” only the candidates with set of skills, experience, education “bcd” are considered, it may in fact broaden the scope on one hand and better the profiling on other hand for candidates searches best fit to perform given tasks with desired outcomes. 

The problems above affect virtually entire career planning, job seeking and recruitment processes, meaning that solution would affect anyone in working age and young people planning the possible study, technical skills or work paths selection as well as HR, recruitment and compensation boards of all employers across the EU.  

List of Problems (presented in questions form that the AI solution may provide the comprehensive answers to in much more efficient way than ever before):
* problem 1 - How to perform a well informed decision for a career planning before the first work experience & at all consecutive experience levels?      
* problem 2 - What are the skills needed to achieve desired career path? 
* problem 3 - Probability of carrer in the desired profession within local 
* problem 3 - Where in Europe it is most likely to deploy and advance in desired career model?

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
