# AITalentFairEU (AITFE): Smart Selection & Salary Clarity
Final project for the Building AI course (written at the beginners level by non-coding participant)

## Summary

With the introduction of Directive (EU) 2023/970 – “Equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women – Rules on pay transparency” – EU members have obligation to transpose these rules in the national frameworks, the deadline for implementation at a national level is the 6 June 2026. This may become a perfect opportunity to provide a new exciting EU wide AI solution for a job seekers and recruiters alike. 


## Legal Framework Background

The regulation primary focus is on closing unjustified gender pay gap men/women – but as far as I am concerned this in fact is far more reaching than just differences in gender pay tracking and resolution, as in fact the data obtained may reveal much more information beyond the original purpose and if analysed and applied correctly, can and will benefit the entire population of all employees giving a way to revolutionary solutions that can shape futures of millions of people in the EU.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE (EU) 2023/970?
It lays down minimum rules to reinforce:

respect for the principle of equal pay* for equal work or work of equal value between men and women;
the prohibition of any direct or indirect pay discrimination* on grounds of sex;
pay transparency and stronger enforcement of the right to equal pay.
KEY POINTS
The directive applies to:

public and private sector employers;
all workers with an employment contract or employment relationship defined by law, collective agreement and/or practice.
Equal pay for equal work or work of equal value

European Union (EU) Member States ensure that employers have pay structures that exclude any pay discrimination on grounds of sex.
The assessment of comparable work is to be based on criteria including skills, effort, responsibility and working conditions, and other criteria that are relevant to the specific job or position. Criteria must be applied in an objective gender-neutral manner, excluding any direct or indirect discrimination based on sex.
Pay transparency measures stipulate that:

job applicants:
have the right to information from the prospective employer before an interview on the initial pay of the job position or its range and, where relevant, details of the provisions of the collective agreement applied by the employer in relation to the position;
workers:
have the right to request (directly or through their workers’ representatives or national equality body) information on their individual pay level and the average pay levels, broken down by sex, for categories of workers performing the same work as them or work of equal value to theirs,
will not be prevented from disclosing their pay for the purpose of the enforcement of the principle of equal pay;
employers:
may not ask job applicants about their current or previous pay,
ensure that vacancy notices and job titles are gender neutral and recruitment processes are non-discriminatory,
make easily accessible to their workers the criteria that are used to determine workers’ pay, pay levels and pay progression, and those criteria shall be objective and gender neutral,
inform all their employees annually of their right to request and receive in writing information on their individual pay and average pay levels broken down by sex for colleagues doing the same work or work of equal value,
provide information such as the gender pay gap and the proportion of female and male staff receiving complementary or variable components (this requirement will be gradually introduced from 7 June 2027, for employers with more than 100 workers, depending on company size),
cooperate with workers’ representatives to identify, remedy and prevent discriminatory pay differences when their pay reporting reveals a gender pay gap above 5% that cannot be justified by objective, gender-neutral criteria and was not tackled within 6 months.
Member States:

ensure the availability of analytical tools or methodologies to assess and compare the value of different jobs at the employer’s level;
provide technical assistance and training to help employers with fewer than 250 staff comply with the requirements of the directive;
take measures to ensure social partners are actively involved, without prejudice to the autonomy of the social partners and in accordance with national law and practice.

## AI Solution Background

The creative solution can support all employees during and even before the commencement of professional life, by providing reliable and transparent tool for a well informed career planning. This can be achieved by data driven analysis model used to compare existing real live data on salary thresholds versus employees profiles (i.e. skills, education, experience etc.) versus purchasing power parity (PPP) across different geographies of the EU as well as it could extrapolate employment trends based of historic data growth/decline in employment numbers per sector/ business line/ region etc..   

From the HR & recruitment perspectives the solution could eliminate some or common screening errors where the CVs are beings erroneously rejected due to automated screening tools being unable recognise differences in key word paraphrasing, or insufficient HR experience in specialist areas which could lead to unjustified candidates rejection and losing out on best talent sourcing opportunities. Transparency across sectors/ roles/ geographies would also benefit HR departments and Compensation Boards to better align their remuneration processes and avoid potential mismatch between expected and actual salary levels. Another attention point may be associated with the profiles of the candidates, if some employees in country “A” perform a specific job with set of skills, experience, education “abc” but in country “B” only the candidates with set of skills, experience, education “bcd” are considered, it may in fact broaden the scope on one hand and better the profiling on other hand for candidates searches best fit to perform given tasks with desired outcomes. 

The problems above affect virtually entire career planning, job seeking and recruitment processes, meaning that solution would affect anyone in working age and young people planning the possible study, technical skills or work paths selection as well as HR, recruitment and compensation boards of all employers across the EU.  

List of Problems (presented in questions form that the AI solution may provide the comprehensive answers to in much more efficient way than ever before):

Employees
* problem 1 - How to perform a well informed decision for a career planning before the first work experience & at all consecutive experience levels?      
* problem 2 - What are the hard/ soft skills needed to achieve desired career path - based of real live professional profiling - not just theoritical? 
* problem 3 - What kind of training/ eperience is necessary? 
* problem 4 - Where this training experience can be obtained?
* problem 5 - Probability of carrer in the desired profession within local geography - based of real business volume and growth/decline forecasting? 
* problem 6 - Where in Europe it is most likely to deploy and advance in desired career model? 
* problem 7 - How much money can the desired career bring at different levels of seniority in the entire lifetime of employment?
* problem 8 - Is the carrer path sustainable at any given region - in nominal and real terms (PPP) salary levels - would one be able to support a sustainable life style, create a family, afford the house etc. or different path should be selected? 
* problem 9 - Is it possible that the similar career path may offer much more favorable outcomes in other member state on purchasing power parity basis?
* problem 10 - What is the value of similar positions across the same and different industries?

Employers (HR, recruitment, compensation boards)
* problem 1 - How to avoid missing on good candidates during the recruitment process? 
* problem 2 - How do you compare different people skills for target positions versus practices for similar/ the same positions in other jurisdictions/ sectors/ business lines? 
* problem 3 - How to gain valuable insight for salary benchmarking against broad market and positioning within any given type of organization?
* problem 4 - How to avoid discriminatory practices, conscious/ unconscious biases in the work environment, avoid authorities scrutiny, remediation and/or penalty processes? 
* problem 5 - How to remain fair & competitive at the same time?
* problem 6 - How to reduce costs/time associated with the recruitment processes based on data based solutions?
* problem 7 - How to Estimate, communicate of potential shortage/surpluses of desired candidates profiles in the given market and compare versus other markets with similar or the same specifications? 
* problem 8 - How to identify and mitigate biases in recruitment processes by analyzing patterns of candidate selection and offering suggestions for more inclusive hiring practices?
* problem 9 - How to avail of all the data in one place, which is otherwise hugely fragmented and dispersed across multiple platforms and sources?   
* problem 10 - How to create personalized dashboards for users to track their career progress, set goals, and access relevant resources and recommendations?




## How is it used?

The idea behind this project is to provide the most complete and comprehensive tool up to date, where usually two "opposing" teams (Employees or job seekers vs HR/ Compensations boards) are brought together as partners to engage in fully transparent process, benefitting both parties by eliminating some of grey areas which have been traditionally associated with recruitment processes, by removal of information asymmetry, providing the structural framework on the rights and obligations, levelling playing field across the candidates (by upfront provision of realistic and fair salary ranges the candidates can expect given specific profile skills and experience prior to engagement & the valuable insight on the skills most likely needed to be successful ) & the recruiters competing for talent (providing clear view of the fair pricing practices, competitors benchmarking, and potential for better candidates profiling/ screening).



## Data sources and AI methods

Potential Data Sources:

With the transposition of the European directive on salary transparency in to the national systems as well as enhanced employees rights to demand and/or openly share/discuss the data on equivalent value positions salary ranges and career progression ranges, we can expect the new data bases to emerge in short term future and/or existing service providers to gain access to much wider scpoe of data than currently present in the market at both national level and consolidated at the European level. Whilst it is unclear how much of the reporting data provided by employers to monitoring bodies designated by the members states will be shared with the public, the opportunity arise to get ahead of curve and propose public private co-op in order to make the best use case and standardized solution to be broadly applied at the Europen level with a full adherence to privacy regulations and best practices for handling sensitive personal data, such as anonymization techniques or differential privacy mechanisms.

Existing Data Sources:

* Eurostat: Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union and provides a wide range of data related to employment, salaries, demographics, and economic indicators across EU member states.

* National Statistical Institutes: Each EU member state has its own national statistical institute that collects and publishes data on various aspects of the economy, including salaries, employment, and workforce demographics.

* Job Portals: Websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor provide valuable data on job listings, salaries, and employer information across different industries and regions.

* Government Agencies: Government agencies responsible for labor and employment, such as the Department of Labor in each EU country, often collect and publish data on employment trends, wage statistics, and labor market forecasts.

* Surveys and Reports: Academic research, industry reports, and surveys conducted by organizations such as the OECD, World Bank, and HR consulting firms can provide insights into salary trends, skill demands, and employment forecasts.

* Company Databases: Some companies publicly disclose salary information, employee demographics, and recruitment practices in their annual reports or corporate social responsibility disclosures.

* Purchasing Power Parity Data: Organizations like the World Bank and IMF publish data on purchasing power parity, which can be used to adjust salary data for cost-of-living differences across countries.

* Education and Training Institutions: Universities, vocational schools, and training providers may offer data on course offerings, enrollment statistics, and job placement rates for different programs.

* Labor Market Platforms: Online platforms that connect job seekers with employers often gather data on job listings, applicant profiles, and recruitment trends that can be valuable for analysis.

* Open Data Repositories: Open data repositories like data.europa.eu and Kaggle offer access to a wide range of datasets related to employment, salaries, demographics, and other relevant topics.

Machine Learning Models:

* Regression Models: Use regression models to estimate salary ranges based on factors such as experience, education, industry, and location.
* Classification Models: Employ classification models to categorize skills, job roles, or industries based on textual data from job descriptions or resumes.
* Clustering Algorithms: Apply clustering algorithms to group similar job roles or profiles together based on features such as skills, education, or experience.
* Time Series Forecasting: Utilize time series forecasting techniques to predict future employment trends and demand for specific skills or industries.
  
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

* Keyword Extraction: Use NLP techniques to extract key skills, qualifications, or job requirements from textual data such as job postings or resumes.
* Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on job postings or employee reviews to identify trends or patterns in employer satisfaction and job preferences.
* Named Entity Recognition (NER): Employ NER to identify and categorize entities such as job titles, company names, or educational institutions mentioned in textual data.
  
Data Visualization Tools:

* Dashboarding Platforms: Use dashboarding tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly Dash to create interactive dashboards for visualizing employment trends, salary distributions, and geographic variations.
* Heatmaps and Choropleths: Visualize regional differences in salary levels, employment growth, or skill demand using heatmaps or choropleth maps.
  
Deep Learning Models:

* Neural Networks: Utilize neural networks for more complex tasks such as image recognition (e.g., analyzing company logos or job-related images) or sequence modeling (e.g., predicting career trajectories based on historical data).
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Employ RNNs or LSTMs for analyzing sequential data such as time series data or textual data with temporal dependencies.
  
AI-powered Recruitment Tools:

* Resume Screening Algorithms: Integrate AI-powered resume screening algorithms to automatically evaluate candidate resumes and identify top matches based on predefined criteria.
* Candidate Ranking Systems: Develop candidate ranking systems that leverage AI to prioritize candidates based on their fit for specific job roles or organizational requirements.
* Bias Detection Algorithms: Implement AI algorithms to detect and mitigate biases in recruitment processes, ensuring fair and unbiased candidate selection.
  
Collaborative Filtering:

* Recommendation Systems: Implement recommendation systems to suggest relevant job opportunities, training programs, or career paths based on the user's profile, preferences, and historical behavior.
  
Model Evaluation and Optimization:

* Cross-validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance and ensure robustness across different datasets or subsets of data.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search or random search to improve model performance and generalization ability.
  
Ethical AI Practices:

* Fairness and Bias Mitigation: Implement techniques to ensure fairness and mitigate biases in AI models, such as fairness-aware learning algorithms or bias detection metrics.
* Privacy Preservation: Adhere to privacy regulations and best practices for handling sensitive personal data, such as anonymization techniques or differential privacy mechanisms.

## Challenges

What the project will not solve: 

* Knowledge of the best place to work within EU for any given skills and/or profession suggesting the highest chance for best sustainable working/living conditions or career development does not necessary solve the candidates/ recruiters problems as there are many factors affecting potential mobility across the members states (i.e. 24 different languages, willingness/ability to relocate, cultural differences, weather conditions etc.), but it allows for a better planning of skills/ career development path, providing guide for a well informed decision making.
* Knowledge of variety of profiles that perform well in different roles, does not guarantee that sufficient amount of candidates can be sourced immediately to meet the hiring demands, but if communicated constantly over years to public, students, candidates, educational facility, training providers it might improve a chance that the right skills/training are developed at the right time to meet the demand.

What are ethical and privacy concerns:

* Privacy preservantion and also the data collection/storage/usage is highly regulated in EU and as such, all aspects of users data have to comply with GDPR and/or other relevant regulations.
* Handling of sensitive information - with care, diligence, security
* Fairness and Bias mitigation - should be at the forefront of the solution dealing with equality and inclussion. 


## What next?

Whilst I recognize that there are some unknown variables included in this thesis and that it is much easier to create an idea than to actually execute it, especially when considering the AI solution after spending just a few hours of online beginners training on fundamentals of AI and with virtually zero coding skills might be "a bit" far fetched. Considering the complexity, number and volume of data/ data sources and potential AI solutions needed to be deployed for such a huge project, may be hard to comprehend and that putting it to work is close to impossible (without the institutional  backing and access to close to unlimited resources), inspired by BuildingAI course I took the opportunity to dream BIG, whilst considering linking the real-live problems with regulatory changes and sketching potential for AI solutions.

Note to whomever might be interested by this topic: I am open to collaborate with developers or data scientists who have experience in AI development, may have similar interests or are developing similar ideas, I am experienced in regulatory/ financial/ core banking projects from a non IT perspective but having worked closely with IT departments on transition, transformation, product development/ enhancement programs/projects/initiatives in the financial institutions (none of which involved AI solutions so far).
